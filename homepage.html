<center> <h2> Why we created this website! </h2></center>
<center><h3> We created this website as a class assignment. We had the choice to create any website we desired and we wanted to make this! After seeing so many reviews on websites and podcasts, we wanted a place where we can do them ourselves.</h3></center>
